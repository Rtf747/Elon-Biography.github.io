      <h4 class="t1">Early Life</h4>
      <p class="p1">Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.
        As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to
        check his hearing.</p>
      <p class="p1">At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in
        computers.
        He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called
        Blastar.</p>
      <p class="p1">In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish.
        He was bullied until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate
        and wrestling.</p>

      <h4 class="t1">Education</h4>
      <p class="p1">At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University.
        Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain
        American citizenship via that path.</p>
      <p class="p1">In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania.
        He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.

      <p class="p1">After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy
        physics.</p>

        in stock.

        miles in approximately four months.</p>
